# Project Name: Trading Strategy Stocastic Oscilator

## Description

This project, developed during the Computational Finance course at Questrom, aims to create a straightforward trading algorithm and assess its performance through backtesting using real-world data. The primary financial concept utilized in the development of this algorithm is the Stochastic Oscillator. For a more detailed understanding of how this concept is applied, please refer to the main project file.

## Introduction

The project revolves around designing a trading strategy based on the Stochastic Oscillator and evaluating its effectiveness when applied to real-world financial data. This README provides an overview of the project, its dependencies, usage instructions, algorithm details, data source, backtesting methodology, and summarizes the results.

## Dependencies

To use this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running project notebooks)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Yahoo Finance API (for data retrieval)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the algorithm and backtesting results.

## Algorithm Details

The core of the trading algorithm is based on the Stochastic Oscillator. A comprehensive explanation of the algorithm's logic and implementation can be found in the main project file.

## Data Source

For this project, we used pricing data freely available from Yahoo Finance. The data includes historical price information for the asset being traded.

## Backtesting Methodology

The backtesting process involved comparing the returns generated by the trading strategy against a simple "buy and hold" strategy for the same asset. This methodology allows us to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm over time.

## Results

The results of the backtesting analysis can be found in the project's Jupyter Notebook files. These results provide insights into how the algorithm performed in comparison to the baseline "buy and hold" strategy.
